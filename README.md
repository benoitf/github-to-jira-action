# GitHub to Jira Action üöÄ

Welcome to **GitHub to Jira Action**! This GitHub Action automates the synchronization of issues, sprints, story points, and statuses between GitHub Projects and Jira Projects. It helps to streamline your project management by mapping relevant fields from GitHub to Jira, so you can easily manage your tasks and track progress.

## Key Features üåü
- Synchronize **GitHub issues** with **Jira tasks**.
- Automatically map **issue types** (Epics, Features, Bugs, etc.) from GitHub labels to Jira issue types.
- Map **sprint**, **story points**, and **status** from GitHub Projects to Jira.
- Supports **batch synchronization** with custom batch size configurations.
- **status mapping** from GitHub to Jira with default values.
  
## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
This GitHub Action reads configuration from a YAML file to map your GitHub issues and project data to corresponding fields in Jira. The tool enables seamless integration, updating Jira based on changes made in GitHub issues.

### What is Mapped?
- **Story Points**: Extracted from a GitHub custom field and synced to Jira.
- **Status**: Mapped from GitHub issue status to Jira issue status.
- **Sprints**: Synced from GitHub to the corresponding Jira sprint board.
- **Issue Types**: GitHub labels are mapped to Jira issue types (e.g., Epic, Feature, Bug, Task).

## Configuration üìã

To use **GitHub to Jira Action**, configure the tool using a YAML file that defines the mappings and project synchronization details.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how to configure the YAML file:

Store it under the name sync.yaml at the root folder of the repository.

### Example YAML Configuration

syncProjects:
  - name: "Podman Desktop"
    github:
      owner: my-organization-on-github
      repo: my-repository-name
      # the name of the Github Project v2 defining all sprints
      project: My Project Planning
      # start sync from every issues updated after this date
      # after the first run, it'll be changed in the state
      # to a more recent date
      afterDate: 2024-04-25
    useMapping:
     issueType: My Issue Mapping
     statusType: My Status Mapping
    jira:
      projectKey: MY-JIRA-PROJECT-KEY
      component: My Component

    # maximum number of issues to synchronize at each batch for this project
    maxBatchSize: 50
```

## How to Use üöÄ

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Workflow

In your repository, create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/sync.yml`) and add the following:

```yaml
name: Sync GitHub to Jira

on:
  schedule:
    # Sync every hour
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Restore state
        run: |
          # read secrets that has the state
            echo "$SYNC_STATE" > sync-state.yaml
        env:
          SYNC_STATE: ${{ secrets.SYNC_STATE }}

      - name: Run GitHub to Jira Action
        uses: your-org/github-to-jira-action@v1
        with:
          jiraHost: ${{ secrets.JIRA_HOST }
          jiraWriteToken: ${{ secrets.JIRA_WRITE_TOKEN }
          # needs to be able to read all projects/issues from referenced GitHub issues in the yaml file
          githubReadToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }

      - name: Save state for the next run
        run: |
          # use gh cli to save the content of a file into a secret
          gh secret set SYNC_STATE --body "$(cat sync-state.yaml)"
```


### Step 2: Configure Secrets üîê

You need to provide Jira credentials and GitHub tokens as secrets in your repository:

1. Go to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in your GitHub repository.
2. Add the following secrets:
   - **JIRA_WRITE_TOKEN**: Your Jira Rest API token to write.
   - **JIRA_HOST**: The base URL of your Jira instance.
   - **GITHUB_READ_TOKEN**: GitHub token to access the repository.

---

### Step 3: Add the YAML Configuration

Place your YAML configuration file in `sync.yaml`.

---

### Step 4: Run the Action

Once the workflow and configuration file are set, the action will automatically run based on your schedule or you can manually trigger it from the **Actions** tab in your repository.

---

## Advanced Options üõ†Ô∏è

- **Max Batch Size**: Control how many issues are synced in one batch. Set `maxBatchSize` to `0` for turn it off.
- **Status Mappings**: Customize how GitHub statuses (e.g., "üìã Backlog", "üöß In Progress") are mapped to Jira statuses.
- **Date Filtering**: Use the `afterDate` field to only sync issues created after a specific date.

---

## Troubleshooting ‚ùì

- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure your Jira API token and GitHub tokens are correctly configured in GitHub secrets.
- **Sync Errors**: Check the logs in the **Actions** tab for detailed information on any errors during synchronization.
- **Always syncing the same issues**: Check the save/restore part of the state. Without state, it is always starting from the same date.
